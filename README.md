## ESS bitbucket account is required

One needs to have the ESS bitbucket accout. **make init** will ask the bitbucket user name and its password. In order to minimize that case, one can add the ssh key in ones account. After that, the following command should be executed in order to use the different url instead of the default one.


```
git config --global url."git@bitbucket.org:".insteadOf https://bitbucket.org/
```
